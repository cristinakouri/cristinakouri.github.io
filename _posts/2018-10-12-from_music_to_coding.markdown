Prior to just a few months ago, I worked mainly as a music teacher in and around the DMV area. I taught privately as well as in schools, and my students ranged from toddlers to grandparents. For me, music was always something that I loved doing, but as time went on I found it harder and harder to make a decent living doing it. From summer vacations, to last minute cancellations, my month-to-month income had become highly unpredictable. So, after several months of living on a tight ramen-style budget, I decided that it was time to make a career change. 

In December of 2017 I stumbled upon codecademy.com after googling something along the lines of “good jobs 2018” and reading about web development. While I had never considered myself a tech person, I immediately became hooked and started learning basic HTML and CSS. I found that there were a lot of similarities between playing the piano and coding – from the daily repetition and practice to the creativity aspect. Most of all, it was really fun! Because of that, coding turned out to be something that was relatively easy for me to transition into. Before I knew it I was putting together simple web pages using the ideas that I had picked up from these online courses and tutorials. 

I continued teaching myself to code and progressing over the course of the next few months. I even managed to land a job at a lawyer’s association working as a web specialist, where I currently work! While it’s been a great few months, I know that I will eventually want to transition to a position where I get to use other programming languages and work as an actual developer. That’s my ultimate goal. I enrolled in the flatiron school with the hopes of really diving deep into programming and building applications, and am super excited to see where this journey takes me!
